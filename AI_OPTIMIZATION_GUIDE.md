## Overview

This document outlines how the Supplementary Angles website is optimized for visibility and inclusion in AI-powered search platforms, including ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and others.

### What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

GEO is the strategic process of optimizing content to:
- Increase visibility in AI-powered search engines
- Get cited and referenced in AI-generated responses
- Improve the chances of being featured in AI platform summaries
- Ensure content is properly indexed by AI crawlers

Unlike traditional SEO (which optimizes for Google's SERP rankings), GEO focuses on making content discoverable and valuable for AI language models.
