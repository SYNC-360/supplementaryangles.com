# Deploy Via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest Method)

## Why Use the Dashboard?

The CLI is having permission issues with the parent directory. The easiest solution is to use Vercel's web dashboard, which works perfectly for your static site.

---

## Deploy in 6 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
```
https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

### Step 2: Click "Add New" Button
- Located in top-left area
- Select "Project" from dropdown

### Step 3: Import Your Repository
**Option A: Connect GitHub**
- Vercel asks: "Where is your code?"
- Select: "GitHub"
- Search for: `supplementaryangles`
- Click: `SYNC-360/supplementaryangles.com`

**Option B: Continue with GitHub Account**
- Click "Continue with GitHub"
- Authorize Vercel if prompted

### Step 4: Configure Project
When you see the import screen, set:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Project Name | `supplementaryangles` |
| Framework | `Other` (static site) |
| Root Directory | `./` |
| Build Command | *(leave empty)* |
| Output Directory | `./` |
| Environment | *(none needed)* |

**Important:** Leave Build Command empty - this is a static HTML site, no build needed!

### Step 5: Click "Deploy"
- Blue "Deploy" button
- Vercel starts building and deploying
- Takes 1-2 minutes

### Step 6: Your Site is Live! ðŸŽ‰
- Vercel shows: "Congratulations!"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No projects found"
**Solution:**

- GitHub should be connected
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue: "Build failed"
**Solution:**
- This is normal for static sites
- The site will still deploy
- Ignore the build error message
- Your site works fine

### Issue: Blank page after deploy
**Solution:**
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Try different browser

### Issue: Calculator not working
**Solution:**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify JavaScript is enabled
- Refresh page
- Try on different browser

### Issue: PWA install button not showing
**Solution:**
